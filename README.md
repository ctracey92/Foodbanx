* About
A meal search engine that allows you to save recipes for future use and create a grocery list out of the ingredients needed for the saved recipes.

* Approach
    - We began by identifying and testing the possible API's as that was going to be the crux of our project.
    - Once we found the API's and got them working, we linked in Firebase (to save results), and created a basic HTML format so we could work on dynamically having the JSON responses display to the page using Jquery.
    - Finally we added in the Semantic UI classes/id's to format/style the page.
